# Interscroller
The Interscroller is an inline interstitial ad format. The content comes into view as the user scrolls the publisher page and covers the entire smartphone screen.

To upload the creative within Pexi you need a Pexi account and access to the correct advertiser. You can request a Pexi account via traffic@pexi.nl. When you have access to Pexi you can upload the banner as a zip (zip the folder, not the files). If you include the IAB size within the filename Pexi will automatically detect and adjust the upload settings.
